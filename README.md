A work-in-progress Windows/Linux/macOS port of Mario Party 4.

This repository does **not** contain any game assets or assembly whatsoever. An existing copy of the game is required.

Supported versions:

- `GMPE01_00`: Rev 0 (USA)

### 1. Download [Party Board](https://github.com/mariopartyrd/partyboard/releases)

### 2. Setup the game

- Extract the .zip file
- If you don't want to browse the game image of GMPE01 version 1.0 on every startup, rename your .iso/.rvz to `GMPE01_00` and place it inside the extracted folder.
- Launch partyboard or partyboard.exe depending on your platform.

# Building

If you'd like to build Party Board from source, please read the [build instructions](building.md).

## Common problems

### RenderDoc not working

RenderDoc has some conflict with asan. To turn off asan, you should delete the two lines in `CMakeLists.txt` that enable ASAN for the DOL and the RELs: `set_source_files_properties(..., -fsanitize=address)`
